# texas-holdem-tracker
A circuit that enables up to 6 players to join a Texas Hold'em round. 
It has two buttons. Button 1 initializes the number of players, and button 2 starts the game.
Then, button 2 is used to traverse the table in a clockwise fashion, and determine the big and small blind.
If someone in the round has been evicted, then button 1 is pressed to signal their loss, but the big and small blind continue as normal, without that player in the game.
